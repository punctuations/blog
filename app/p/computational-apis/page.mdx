In the dynamic landscape of technology, APIs have emerged as the linchpin connecting diverse applications and services, fostering seamless communication and data exchange.
Among a myriad of APIs avaliable, Wolfram's stands out as a robust gateway to a wealth of compuatational knowledge and sophisticated algorithms.

Wolfram, known for its groundbreaking Mathematica software, as well as the very helpful Wolfram|Alpha, has extended its reach into the realm of APIs via wolfram cloud, offering developers and enthusiats a powerful toolkit to integrate cutting-edge computational capabilities into their applications.
From advanced data analysis to natural language understand and expansive knowledge databases, Wolfram's APIs open doors to a vast ecosystem of possibilities. 

Here, we will be creating a astronomy API.

To begin, the API is broken up into three parts:
1. Deployment
2. Data
3. Serialization

### Deployment

Deployment of APIs is done via [wolfram cloud](https://wolframcloud.com), and is accomplished by using the [`CloudDeploy[]`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/CloudDeploy.html) as well as the [`APIFunction`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/APIFunction.html) function.

To get started with deploying a basic API we can use the following:
```wolfram
CloudDeploy[
 APIFunction[{"date" ->  "String" -> ""}, 
  ExportString[{"name"-> "John", "name"-> "Doe"}, "JSON", "Compact"->True] &, "String"], "api/astro", 
 Permissions -> "Public"]
```

Breaking this down, here we are taking in a parameter of `date`, such that the request url would be `https://example.com/api/atro?date="November 17 2023"`.
It should also be noted that there is a default value for `date` if it is not provided, which is a empty string. The date can be accessed using #date afterwards.
In this example, making a request would give back the following response:
```json title="GET https://example.com/api/atro?date=November 17 2023"
{
    "name": "Matt",
    "date": "November 17 2023"
}
```

But since we have a static dataset there will be no change with a change in the `date` parameter (i.e. `date` is not being utilized)

We can fix this by moving our expressing into a function!

### Data

To expand and allow this to have more functionality we can move the response of the api into its own function, although it should be noted that if a parameter is passed in and the function is __not__ static in nature then function will have to be evaluated at runtime using [`:=`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SetDelayed.html).

If we wanted to return the name of the current (or past) moon phase having taken a date as the parameter we could move the computation into its own function and call the [`MoonPhase`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/MoonPhase.html) function.

```wolfram
handleParse[date_] := If[date == "", {"state" -> MoonPhase["Name"] @ "Name"}, {"state"-> MoonPhase[FromDateString[date], "Name"] @ "Name"}]

CloudDeploy[
 APIFunction[{"date" ->  "String" -> ""}, 
  ExportString[handleParse[#date], "JSON", "Compact"->True] &, "String"], "api/astro", 
 Permissions -> "Public"]
```

Having the date as an optional parameter means that we must also account for any situation where the `date` is not provided, and thus we have to seperate `handleParse` function into two conditions.

An example query to the endpoint now would give back the following:
```json title="GET https://example.com/api/atro?date=November 1 2001"
{
    "state": "full moon"
}
```

Similarly, if we were to query the endpoint __without__ a date included it would simply give back the moon state at the current date.

### Serialization

The [`ExportString`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/ExportString.html?q=ExportString) function wrapping the data is key to have the API to work correctly (assuming you want a JSON response), this function speicifies the payload, the format, and the (optional) compact parameter (which just makes the JSON compact vs pretty).
Therefore, all the data must also be in a format where no further evaluation is needed (at least when it reaches this serialization step), failure to do so will result in failure at evaluation or on the endpoint. (tl;dr: watch the data-types)

This step also cannot be skipped either, as the data structure for wolfram objects vs. json structure is __quite__ different. (Unless you just want a static string that is.)


### Conclusion

All-in-all, utilizing wolfram's abilities to make difficult computational apis is a great solution, and, of course, this can be expanded to a lot more than just atronomy.

Many cool projects pop-up all the time over on the [Wolfram Community](https://community.wolfram.com), and is a great source of inspiration for anyone looking!
