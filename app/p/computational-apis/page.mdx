In the dynamic landscape of technology, APIs have emerged as the linchpin connecting diverse applications and services, fostering seamless communication and data exchange.
Among a myriad of APIs avaliable, Wolfram's stands out as a robust gateway to a wealth of compuatational knowledge and sophisticated algorithms.

Wolfram, known for its groundbreaking Mathematica software, as well as the very helpful Wolfram|Alpha, has extended its reach into the realm of APIs via wolfram cloud, offering developers and enthusiats a powerful toolkit to integrate cutting-edge computational capabilities into their applications.
From advanced data analysis to natural language understand and expansive knowledge databases, Wolfram's APIs open doors to a vast ecosystem of possibilities. 

Here, we will be creating a astronomy API.

```typescript
export const HelloWorld = (p: string) => {
    /* print out hello message to p, person. */
    console.log(`Hello, ${p}!`)
}
```
